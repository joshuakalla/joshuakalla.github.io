Welcome! I am an Associate Professor of [Political Science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) and [Data Science](https://datascienceethics.yale.edu/) at Yale University.

My research focuses on persuasion, prejudice reduction, and political campaigns. I use large-scale field experiments to study how people's political attitudes and behaviors can be changed. My work has appeared in *Science*, the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, and other leading journals.

I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.

You can download my [CV](/files/Kalla_CV.pdf) here, and you can contact me at josh.kalla@yale.edu.

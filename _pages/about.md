He is also a Resident Fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and the Center for the Study of American Politics.

His research lies at the intersection of political behavior, campaigns, and causal inference, with a particular focus on field experimentation.

Kalla is a recipient of the Yale Arthur Greer Memorial Prize for outstanding faculty research and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology's Robert B.
